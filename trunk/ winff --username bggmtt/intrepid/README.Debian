Not all the original presets that come with WinFF work with the Debian
version of ffmpeg. Therefore, a filtered version is provided as a
standard. The original presets are still provided in 
/usr/share/winff/presets-orig.xml and can be loaded into the program.

The version of ffmpeg in Ubuntu can at this moment convert all the
formats in the current presents, only when libavcodec-unstripped-51
is installed (via (k)ubuntu-restricted-extras).
