                           These presets are intended to hit the "sweet spot" for each individual Codec. All the most commonly used Codecs are represented WAV,MP3,AAC,MPEG-1,MPEG-2,AVI,MPEG-4,H.264 and FLV. They have been written with a tip of the balance to quality. Fast encoders that give crap results aren't much good to anyone. IMHO With faster CPUs, cheaper and larger storage media, and better visual displays (Plasmas, LCD's) coming out all the time there is no sense in lowballing bitrates and sacrificing quality! --End of Rant--
